            <p>David Rego was born in 1987 in Madrid, where he spent his childhood and adolescent years. After his principal studies in Art, his interest increased towards the direction of Photography which later led him to complete a Masters in the field.<br><br>
          Upon finishing his studies, he was able to collaborate with recognised professional photographers such as Ricardo Cases, Chema Conesa, and Rosa Muñoz.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2014 he moved to Berlin, where he still currently resides and takes inspiration to develop his photographic style.<br>
          <br>
          As for his works, he uses diverse objects, spaces and abstracts to create a pure and direct dialogue with the viewer and their emotions.
          <br><br>

          Through his still life pieces, David intends to demonstrate his inclination towards the genre, as well as tying together his work with another of his facets: the editorial.
          <br><br>

          Ultimately, he seeks to carry out an exercise in style and reflection. To pose certain questions and at the same time allow the spectator to drift to a place that both they and the author ignored initially.

          <br><br>
          It’s all a question of playing with observation and the mind.
